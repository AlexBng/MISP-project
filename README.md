# Terrorism Data Scraper

This project is part of a university course on threat intelligence and aims to scrape data from online databases of terrorist groups and incidents using Python scripts. The collected data will be stored in [MISP objects](https://www.misp-project.org/objects.html), [MISP galaxies](https://www.misp-project.org/galaxy.html) or [taxonomies](https://www.misp-project.org/taxonomies.html) and then published on MISP.

## Progress

- 13/01/2023 : for the moment the script scrap.py is used to scrap the website [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/) with the libraries [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/). It stores the name of every terrorist groups (around 3000 groups) and the ids of their incidents. Then it stores separatly the characteristic of every incidents. Since I havn't that much informations about the terrorist groups, the idea is to first create a galaxy for the incidents and their characteristics in the "meta" field (including the group associated with it) and then i might scrap an other website to get more informations on the terrorist groups (and probably some synonyms of those groups name's) to create an other galaxy. From there I could use the "related" field to link the terrorist groups to their incidents and also use a taxonomie in the "tag" field to specify if the group claimed the responsability of the incident.
- 13/01/2023 : Due to the lack of data on terrorist groups on the scraped website and the absence of information on all groups on other sites, it will not be possible to create a complete galaxy for all these groups. However, Wikipedia lists some groups, so it would be possible to create a partial galaxy of terrorist groups and link them to their incidents by creating a "related" field. In all cases, in the incident galaxy, the "meta" field will have the responsible terrorist groups and when the group exists in the group galaxy, a link to it will be created with the "related" field.
- 18-01-2023 : Most of the informations are scraped from the website but many field changes between incidents, making the scraping pretty hard.So I might stop the scraping here for this version and start creating the galaxy and the cluster (since there is more than 200000 incident I'm not going to put them all in the cluster, I'll probably stop at 5000).
